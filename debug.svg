He also said he had not heard about the reported plot taking place to remove Truss and replace her with Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt.\n\nLord Vaizey added that the mood in the party was "relatively bleak, in the sense that this is a self-inflicted wound".</title><tspan x="0" y="0.0" >Chancellor\'s return \'qui... </tspan> \n</text>\n</g>\n'
